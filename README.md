## HelloWorld

### App Description
HelloWorld is an app used to introduce the basics of mobile app development specifically iOS apps. When users first open the app, they are greeted with a custom text from the creator. Users can change the text color to orange by tapping the "Change Text Color" button. Along with changing the color of the text, users can even change the color of the background to yellow by tapping the "Change View Color" button. Users can freely customize the text by entering a message into the text field and tapping the "Change the Text" button. If the text field is empty, the text will change into "Goodbye!" by default. To reset the app to its original settings, users would simply need to click on the app's background. As can be seen in the gif below, the app's interface is simple to use and easy to understand. 

With the help from CodePath, HelloWorld was developed using Xcode and code was written in Swift.
